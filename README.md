# Planetary Engulfments with MESA
Planets accompany most sun-like stars. 
The orbits of many are sufficiently close that they will be engulfed when their host stars ascend the giant branch.  
Here we study the result of energy deposition into the envelope of a giant star through decay of the orbit of an 
engulfed companion to the intrinsic stellar luminosity. Orbital decay power is generated through gravitational 
interaction between the engulfed companion and the surrounding envelope.
